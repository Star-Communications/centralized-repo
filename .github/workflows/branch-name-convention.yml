# This wrorkflow checks if the PR branch name is following the convention defined in the workflow file.

# If PR branch name doesn't follow specified naming conventions, the workflow fails.

# The workflow takes 2 inputs:
#   1. PR branch name
#   2. Additional branch names to add to naming conventions (comma separated)
